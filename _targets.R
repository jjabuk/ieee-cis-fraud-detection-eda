# The audit graph.
#
# `targets` is to this package what Dagster is to the pipeline: a dependency
# graph with content-addressed invalidation, so re-running after a change
# recomputes the affected audits and nothing else. The two are deliberately not
# connected. Dagster owns everything downstream of the contract; this graph owns
# everything upstream of it, and the contract file is the only thing they share.
#
#   tar_make()          run what is out of date
#   tar_visnetwork()    draw the graph
#   tar_read(tc_report) the scan, as a table
